        steps

    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, <br>
            baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Whisk together buttermilk and eggs and add to flour mixture. <br>
            Fold and stir until just combined. <br>
            Add 3 tablespoons melted butter and stir until incorporated.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Working in batches, spoon about 3 tablespoons batter <br>
            per pancake and spread into circles in the pan. Cook <br>
            until edges start to set and some bubbles start to <br>
            form around edges and in center of batter, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Gently dollop 1 teaspoon Nutella in center of batter <br>
            (it's ok if it isn't a perfect round).
        </li>
        <li>
            Dollop and lightly spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons more <br>
            batter over Nutella to cover completely. Continue cooking <br>
            until bottom and sides of pancake are golden brown and some <br>
            bubbles are starting to form where Nutella is covered, <br>
            about 1 minute.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Carefully flip pancakes and continue cooking until second <br>
            side is golden brown and sides appear matte and cooked through, <br>
            2 to 3 more minutes. Transfer to plates and serve immediately.
        </li><br>
    </ol>
