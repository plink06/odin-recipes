        Description
    </h1>
    <p>
        I love zucchini, and it's always fun to find new ways to use it. 
        I added my favorite zucchini bread ingredients, cinnamon and vanilla, <br>
        to a fluffy pancake recipe! If you like nuts in your quick breads, 
        you may try adding 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to your batter

    <ol>
        <li>
            Add lemon juice to a cup of milk. <br>
            Set aside until milk starts to curdle, <br>
            5 to 10 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder,<br> 
            baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. <br> 
            Make a well in the center. Pour in curdled milk, <br> 
            egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir with a <br>
            spoon or whisk until the batter is just combined. <br>
            Add shredded zucchini and mix until well incorporated. 
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium heat, <br>
            and coat with cooking spray. <br>
            Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, <br>
            and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, <br>
            about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula, <br>
            and cook until browned, about 2 more minutes.
